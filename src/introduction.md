# AO Decoded

Welcome to *AO Decoded*: a book about **AO**, the decentralized supercomputer
built on top of Arweave. This book takes an approachable look at AO and how it works from an
architectural perspective. 

AO is quite a unique piece of architecture, and is a powerful piece of
technology. Due to its novel approach, it requires some new concepts to be learned
which you might not be familiar with. This is true even if you are well-versed in the crypto space.

## Who this book is for

This book is for anyone interested in understanding the architecture and
purpose of AO. 

## The goal of this book

The goal of this book is twofold: to help you **understand how AO works**, and
by extension, help you to realize **the benefits AO offers** resulting from its
architecture.

This book is written in a such a way that it introduces the core technologies and familiar concepts before going into more detail about how they work, and how they differ from other decentralized
networks/blockchains. 

This approach is aimed at making it as easy as possible to get acquainted with
AO. 

## Prerequisites

This book assumes no large prerequisites, but assumes a general understanding
of:

- What blockchain technology is
- Some computing-related terminology

Overall, this book should generally be readable by anyone familiar with how blockchains work, and
are curious about the unique and particular aspects of AO.

We hope this book helps you understand how AO works, and in turn, helps you to
realize the benefits that AO Computer and Arweave can offer as a whole.

## What this book is not

AO Decoded is not a guide on how to create or deploy applications on AO, or
intended as developer documentation. It is also not intended as an explanation
of how to run AO nodes or pieces of infrastructure.
