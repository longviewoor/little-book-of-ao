# Who this book is for

Hello, and welcome to The Little Book of AO!

AO is a decentralized compute network built on top of Arweave, a long-term
storage-focused blockchain.

This means AO is quite a unique piece of architecture, and is a powerful piece of
technology. Due to this architecture, it requires some new concepts to be learned
which you might not be familiar with, even if you are well-versed in the crypto space.

This is why this book exists. It aims to explain concepts related to AO as
simply as possible, and in an order which makes sense.

## Goal

The goal of this book is twofold: to help you **understand how AO works**, and
by extension, help you to realize **the benefits AO offers** resulting from its
architecture.

This book is written in a way which should make it easy to understand
all of the different pieces of AO and how they work together.

It starts with
more basic and familiar concepts, and then goes into more detail about how they
work.

## Prerequisites

This book doesn't have a strong list of prerequisites, but assumes a general understanding of
blockchain technology and some knowledge of computing-related terminology.

Overall, this book should generally be readable by anyone familiar with how blockchains work and
are curious about the unique and particular aspects of AO.

We hope this book helps you understand how AO works, and in turn, helps you to
realize the benefits that AO Computer and Arweave can offer as a whole.
