# Preface

Hello, and welcome to The Little Book of AO!

AO is a complicated piece of technology. We know this well. 

This is why this book exists. We have tried to explain concepts related to AO as
simply as possible, and in an order which (hopefully) makes sense.

## Goal

The goal of this book is twofold: to help you **understand how AO works**, and
by extension, help you to realize **the benefits AO offers** resulting from its
architecture.

This book is written in a way which should make it easy to understand
all of the different pieces of AO and how they work together. It starts with
more basic and familiar concepts, and then goes into more detail about how they
work. 

## Prerequisites

Although this book should be interesting for everyone, there are a couple of
small prerequisites:

- A general understanding of blockchain technology
- Knowledge of some common blockchain and computing-related terminology

We hope this book helps you understand how AO works, and in turn, helps you to
realize the benefits that AO Computer and Arweave can offer as a whole.
