# Inboxes, Outboxes, and CRON Jobs

## Inboxes and Outboxes

Every process has an **Inbox**, which accepts incoming, ordered messages. You can
think of this kind of like a list of pending transactions for a smart contract waiting to be
processed. A process will read these messages in and perform any actions needed.

Processes also have an **Outbox**, which contains messages generated by the
process itself. These could be messages to either send onwards to another process, or update its own state.

## Scheduled tasks

A unique feature of AO is the ability to run **scheduled tasks**. Developers,
and users as well for that matter, can run [CRON jobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron)
which periodically send a message or perform some kind of action from a process.

Let's look at how these nodes communicate with each other and the unique aspect
of transactions, or messages, on AO.
