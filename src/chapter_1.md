# What is AO?

AO is a **decentralized compute network**. 

This is a very vague and nebulous term. But at the essence of it all, this is
what AO is.

## Is AO a blockchain?

Calling AO a blockchain *may* be techincally correct due to some of its inherent
properties, but it is also very different to existing blockchains. 

The best way to think of it is that AO is very much *like* a blockchain. In
fact, as you'll see as we get further into this book, there are actions on AO
which do eventually get settled onchain.  

We will make a lot of comparisons to blockchain networks in this book, and raw
analogies between them and AO in order to make it easier to understand.

## Similarities between AO and existing blockchains

Here are some properties that make AO similar to existing machines:
- There are a connected group of nodes which communicate with each
  other and perform computation
- Computation and state evalutation is paid for in cryptocurrency ($AO)
- There is a consensus mechanism
- There is cryptographic paths which make up blockchain-like structures


## How this book works

This book will tackle the understanding of AO in a few following ways.

It will first establish the very core concepts which make up an AO node, and the
type of things that they can do. This will introduce concepts like **processes**
and **messages**, which are similar to existing blockchain concepts. 

We will then take a look at the **structure** of nodes in more detail, and look
at how these nodes communicate with each other. This is where AO starts to
deviate from traditional blockchain concepts. 

Lastly, we will look at **consensus**, **state**, and **scaling**.

Briefly after this section we will have a reference section which details more
about AO's device mechanism, and how modularity works within a system of
interconnected nodes.
