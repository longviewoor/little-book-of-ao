# AO Nodes

An AO node is a computer, somewhere, running AO's [node
software](https://hyperbeam.arweave.net), which is
called HyperBEAM.

This piece of software is much like the software that Ethereum node operators run. It is
what connects different nodes to each other, handles transactions, and more. 

For now, let's focus on the primary purpose of these nodes - performing
computation. 

In other words, users want to do things. They want to transfer tokens from one account to another, they want to swap
tokens on decentralized exchanges, and interact with different types of smart contracts. 

Like many blockchains, this is one of the things that AO can facilitate.

## Processes

On AO, smart contracts are colloquially referred to as **processes**. 

Processes on AO are written in a programming language called Lua. Developers
write **handlers** which as you might expect "handle" different types of
transactions. 

For example, a decentralized exchange built on AO might have a process with the handlers "swap", "deposit", and "withdraw".

If a user sends a transaction of type "swap", the process runs the relevant code
to handle a swap. If it is deposit, it will run the code in the process for deposit the user's tokens into a pool. And so on.


## Messages

Transactions that users send to processes (and that processes can send to each
other) are referred to as **messages** on AO. 

They function identically to transactions, and as you will see as you get
further into this book, they are signed transactions which get settled onchain. 

## Inboxes and Outboxes

Processes have an **Inbox**, which accepts incoming, ordered messages. You can
think of this kind of like a list of pending transactions waiting to be
processed. 

A process will read these messages in, act on them, and perform any
other actions needed.

Processes also have an **Outbox**, which contains messages generated by the
process itself, to either send onwards to another process, or update its state.

This means processes can call each other, similar to other blockchains and smart
contract platforms. 

## Scheduled tasks

A unique feature of AO is the ability to run **scheduled tasks**. Developers,
and users as well for that matter, can run [CRON jobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron)
which periodically send a message or perform some kind of action from a process.

Let's look at how these nodes communicate with each other and the unique aspect
of transactions, or messages, on AO.
